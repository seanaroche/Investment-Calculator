# Investment-Calculator
A flask web application designed to calculate future value of investments

## About
This application accepts user inputs for the following values: years, initial investment, annual rate of return(ROI), and annual contribution. The value of the investment after the given years is then calculated.

## TODO
* Optimize HTML templates
* User Registration
* Create database for users to log in and save their investment information
* Add options for contribution frequency, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. rather than exclusively annually 
* Add options to change inflation and state/federal taxes
* Testing
